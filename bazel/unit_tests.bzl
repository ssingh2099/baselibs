    This Bazel macro allows to add unit tests on host with a single macro.

    The limitations are that you cannot specify data dependencies and you cannot say that a test is linux only.
    In case you are hit by one of these limitations, you can still do it manually as before without the macro.

    Args:
        name: Name that will be used to create the host test suite. The resulting name will be the provided one concatenated with "_host".
        cc_unit_tests: A list of cc_test targets that should be part of the host test suite.
        visibility: The visibility that the host test suite should have.
        test_suites_from_sub_packages: The test suites from the sub packages that you would like to collect in the newly created test suite.

        Test suite for host

    There are two parts that are not provided intentionally:
    - toolchain features for compiler warnings still need to be provided. The reason why it is not provided is
    to prevent that from the outside it looks like for some target we provide and some not. We can only do that
    if we have this option for the other cc_library targets.
    - dependencies for gtest. The reason is that this is not called cc_gtest_unit_test but generic, that is why for the
    moment we keep it like that. If you want to have gtest dependencies consider using cc_gtest_unit_test.
